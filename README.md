Welcome to your daily and weekly forcast. In here You can search whatever city in USA to forcast the weather. All the data is saved within 
the code so that if for whatever reason the internet crashes, it will display you local and 5 day weather forcast. I created a pop up to 
clearify any instructions. With this pop-up, you do not need to read instructions here. Nonetheless here are the instructions.

  1. The weather forcast is set to chicgo.
  2. On the left text box says "Type your city", type your city and see what your local for cast is and 5 days in advance.
  3. Once the city is typed, the city you typed will be saved.
  4. On the left you will see your city. Say you type another city, it will stack up to the fist searched city (rows).
  5. Without typing the first city you have search for, you can instead click on any rows of cities and preview the forcast. 
This is my simple yet very difficult weatherApp. Search as many cities and have fun!
